Increasing the number of assets in a portfolio leads to a better portfolio upon optimization. For the same portfolio return goal R, the variance (volatility) for the portfolio of eight assets is less compared to the portfolio of three assets. The difference in variance (volatility) is more significant when the portfolio return goal is higher. Adding more assets in the portfolio reduces the risk. This is the result of diversification.
